# Machine learning notes

Types of machine learning
	a. Supervised : Training set will have inputs and outputs.  Algorithm learns the relation between input and output and helps in predicting an output for a new set of input values.
		i. Regression  : Linear Regression
		ii. Classification : Logistic Regression
	b. Unsupervised : Training will only inputs. Algorithm tries to find the relation between the inputs and it helps to deduce the for new input.
		i. Clustering 
		ii. Anomaly detection 
		iii.Dimensionality reduction.
