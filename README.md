# Machine learning notes

## Types of machine learning
1. Supervised : Training set will have inputs and outputs.  Algorithm learns the relation between input and output and helps in predicting an output for a new set of input values.
	* Regression  : Linear Regression
	* Classification : Logistic Regression
2. Unsupervised : Training will only inputs. Algorithm tries to find the relation between the inputs and it helps to deduce the for new input.
		* Clustering 
		* Anomaly detection 
		* Dimensionality reduction.
